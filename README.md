# IShowSpeech

IShowSpeech is an open-source Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) toolkit designed to convert spoken language into text with high accuracy and efficiency. Built with modern deep learning techniques, this repository provides researchers and developers with a flexible framework for speech recognition tasks.

> **Announcement**: We are actively developing and will make the source code public very soon. Star this repository to receive notifications when the code becomes available!

## Key Features

- **State-of-the-art Models**: Implementations of cutting-edge ASR architectures including Transformer, Conformer, and RNN-T based models
- **Pre-trained Checkpoints**: Ready-to-use models trained on diverse speech datasets
- **Data Processing Pipeline**: Comprehensive tools for audio preprocessing and feature extraction
- **Multi-language Support**: Extensible framework for building ASR systems in various languages
- **Inference Optimization**: Tools for model compression and deployment optimization
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed guides for training, fine-tuning, and deploying models
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Built-in WER (Word Error Rate) and CER (Character Error Rate) calculation

## Development Roadmap

IShowSpeech initially focuses on ASR, but will expand to other speech processing tasks in the future, including:
- Audio Classification
- Speaker Recognition
- Text-to-Speech
- Speaker Diarization

**Long-term Goal**: Develop a comprehensive Spoken Dialogue Model capable of understanding and generating natural conversations, integrating ASR, NLU (Natural Language Understanding), and TTS (Text-to-Speech) technologies within a unified framework.
